- How to use TeamsFx to build backend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to use Microsoft Graph API to build a custom Graph Connector.

## Prerequisite to use this sample
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- A Microsoft 365 account. If you do not have Microsoft 365 account, apply one from [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)

### Run the app locally
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Open Debug View (`Ctrl+Shift+D`) and select "Debug (Edge)" or "Debug (Chrome)" in dropdown list.
1. Press "F5" to open a browser window and then select your package to view contact exporter sample app.

### Deploy the app to Azure
> If you don't have an Azure subscription, create [a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) before you begin
1. Open the command palette and select `Teams: Provision`. You will be asked to select Azure resource group to provision the sample.
1. Once provision is completed, open the command palette and select `Teams: Deploy`.

### Preview the app in Teams
1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the APP running in Azure. In Visual Studio Code, open `Run and Debug` and select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` in the dropdown list and Press `F5` or green arrow button to open a browser.

1. Before ingesting data, you need to do 'Admin Consent' with 'ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.OwnedBy' and 'ExternalItem.ReadWrite.All' application permissions for your AAD App in Azure Portal.

    1. Find the client id from the value of `AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID` in `env\.env.xxx` file (e.g. `.env.local` for local environment, `.env.dev` for dev environment).

    1. Sign in to Azure Portal with Microsoft 365 account.

    1. In 'App registrations' blade of Azure Active Directory in Azure Portal, search the client id to find the AAD Application.

1. You could try to ingest data into custom Graph Connector.

    > **Note**: It may take about several minutes for the first time.

    > In addition, you could go to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/connectors) to see the status of custom Graph Connector.

    > If you meet with error of `400` status code, you could try to delete the connection in [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/connectors) and ingest data again.
